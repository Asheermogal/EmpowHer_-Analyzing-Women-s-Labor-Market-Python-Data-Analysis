It rearranges the data so that each row represents a unique combination of 'Country Name,' 'Country Code,' 'Indicator Name,' 'Indicator Code,' and 'Year.' The `id_vars` parameter specifies the columns that will serve as identifiers, and the other columns are \"melted\" into rows.\n","\n","2. **Rename Column**: After melting the DataFrame, the column labeled 'variable' is renamed to 'Year' for clarity. This is done using the `rename` method with the `inplace=True` argument, which modifies the DataFrame in place.\n","\n","The result of running this code will be a new DataFrame, `gender_df`, in a long format with columns 'Country Name,' 'Country Code,' 'Indicator Name,' 'Indicator Code,' and 'Year.' Each row of this DataFrame will represent a specific combination of these identifiers for a particular year, and the actual data values for that year will be stored in a separate column, which was previously labeled as 'variable' but is now renamed to 'Year' for better understanding.\n","\n","The appearance of the output DataFrame will have a structure suitable for various data analysis tasks, such as filtering, aggregating, and visualizing data over time."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":363},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16,"status":"ok","timestamp":1699492489240,"user":{"displayName":"Asheer Mogal","userId":"01179902760994344512"},"user_tz":300},"id":"rZEdJbUhDOwu","outputId":"ca642c2c-ffcd-4447-8ec7-23da90289d2b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                  Country Name Country Code  \\\n","0  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","1  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","2  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","3  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","4  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","5  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","6  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","7  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","8  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","9  Africa Eastern and Southern          AFE   \n","\n","                                      Indicator Name  Indicator Code  Year  \\\n","0  A woman can apply for a passport in the same w...

Here's an explanation of each step:\n","\n","1. **Set a Multi-Index**: The code sets a multi-index on the DataFrame using the `.set_index` method. It specifies that the index levels should be 'Country Name' and 'Year'. This operation organizes the data so that each row is uniquely identified by a combination of country name and year.\n","\n","2. **Sort the DataFrame**: After setting the multi-index, the code sorts the DataFrame based on the multi-index levels. It first sorts by 'Country Name' and then by 'Year'. Sorting the data in this way can be useful for data visualization and analysis tasks, ensuring that the data is organized in a meaningful order.\n","\n","3. **Delete 'Country Code' Column**: The code deletes the 'Country Code' column from the DataFrame using the `del` statement. Since 'Country Code' was likely used for identification and is no longer needed for analysis, removing it can help reduce unnecessary data and simplify the DataFrame.\n","\n","4. **Remove Rows with Missing Values (NaN)**: The code uses the `.dropna` method to remove rows in the DataFrame that contain missing values (NaN). This step is essential for data quality, as it ensures that only rows with complete data are retained for analysis.\n","\n","The result of running this code will be a modified version of the `gender_df` DataFrame with the following characteristics:\n","\n","- It has a multi-index with 'Country Name' and 'Year' as the index levels.\n","- The DataFrame is sorted first by 'Country Name' and then by 'Year.'\n","- The 'Country Code' column is deleted from the DataFrame.\n","- Rows with missing values (NaN) are removed from the DataFrame.\n","\n","This modified DataFrame is now in a structured and clean format, ready for further data analysis, visualization, and other tasks."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":394},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":32,"status":"ok","timestamp":1699492499662,"user":{"displayName":"Asheer

This effectively isolates the data associated with the specified metric.\n","\n","3. **Resetting the Index**:\n","   - Following the filtering step, the code calls `.reset_index()` to reset the index of the filtered data. This ensures that the DataFrame retains a traditional numeric index and that the original index (which included 'Country Name' and 'Year') is added as regular columns.\n","\n","4. **Displaying Data**:\n","   - The code, by displaying the resulting `employment_time_data_indicator1` DataFrame, provides a view of the data associated with the indicator \"Unemployment with advanced education, female (% of female labor force with advanced education).\" This DataFrame now includes information about 'Country Name,' 'Year,' and other relevant columns, allowing the user to analyze and interpret the data for the specified indicator.\n","\n","In summary, this code is an example of how to filter and extract data for a specific gender-related indicator, making it easier to focus on and explore data related to a specific indicator.

The code performs the following steps:\n","\n","1. **Defining Country Lists**: The code begins by defining several lists:\n","   - `all_countries` stores unique country names within the dataset.\n","   - `non_country` lists entities that are not countries and need to be categorized separately.\n","   - `asia`, `europe`, `africa`, and `south_america` list specific countries or regions belonging to these continents.\n","   - `logic` stores keywords used to categorize non-countries.\n","\n","2. **Categorization Function**: The 'make_continent' function is defined to categorize countries into continents based on a set of conditions:\n","   - If the country name contains specific keywords from the 'logic' list or is found in the 'non_country' list, it is categorized as 'ZZ_REGION,' indicating it's not a specific country.\n","   - Countries in Asia, Europe, South America, and Africa are categorized accordingly.\n","   - For all other countries, the code splits the country name to handle cases where there are subdivisions (e.g., \"Country, Subdivision\"). It then utilizes the 'pycountry' library to determine the country's continent based on the alpha-2 country code.\n","\n","3. **Applying the Function**: The 'make_continent' function is applied to the 'Country Name' column in the 'employment_time_data_indicator1' DataFrame. The results are stored in a new 'Continent' column, which now categorizes each country or region into its respective continent.\n","\n","This code aids in the analysis of 'employment_time_data_indicator1' by providing a 'Continent' column, allowing to explore and examine the data in the context of continents, making it easier to identify continent-specific trends and patterns."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":21,"status":"ok","timestamp":1699492499934,"user":{"displayName":"Asheer Mogal","userId":"01179902760994344512"},"user_tz":300},"id":"_FmGJ13Ggdf7","outputId":"c6eac162-5888-4922-9777-55624862d6b8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                                    Indicator Name  \\\n","Continent Country Name     Year                                                      \n","Africa    Algeria          2004  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2017  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Angola           2004  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2009  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2011  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2014  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2019  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2021  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Benin            2011  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2018  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Botswana         2006  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2009  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2010  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2019  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2020  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2021  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2022  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Burkina Faso     2014  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2018  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Burundi          2006  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2014  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2020  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Cabo Verde       2015  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2017  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2018  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2019  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Cameroon         2007  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2014  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Chad             2018  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Comoros          2014  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","                           2021  Unemployment with advanced education, female (...   \n","          Congo, Dem.

The step-by-step explanation is as follows:\n","\n","**Step 1: Set Multi-Index**\n","\n","In this step, a multi-index is established for the DataFrame. The columns 'Continent,' 'Country Name,' and 'Year' are selected as the levels of the index. This hierarchical structure enables data organization and categorization based on these key attributes, facilitating continent-specific and time-based analysis.\n","\n","**Step 2: Sort the DataFrame**\n","\n","After creating the multi-index, the DataFrame is sorted for enhanced clarity. The sorting order first arranges the data by 'Continent,' followed by 'Country Name,' and lastly by 'Year.' This ordered presentation streamlines data analysis and visualization tasks.\n","\n","**Step 3: Display the Data**\n","\n","The final step involves displaying the initial 50 rows of the organized DataFrame, 'continent_employement_time_grouped.' By doing so, users can quickly inspect a portion of the data in its structured form, ideal for continent-specific exploration and analysis.\n","\n","The resulting DataFrame is now structured with a multi-index, making it easier to delve into employment time trends by continent, country, and year."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
